# CS303: Logic and Digital System Design

This repository contains my assignments and projects from the course **CS303: Logic and Digital System Design** at **SabancÄ± University**.

During this course, I learned the basics of digital system design and hardware description using Verilog. The projects involve designing, simulating, and implementing digital circuits.

## Tools and Technologies

- Verilog HDL
- Icarus Verilog (for simulation)
- GTKWave (for waveform viewing)
- FPGA programming (implementation on hardware)

## Repository Contents

- Verilog source files (`.v`)
- Testbenches
- Simulation outputs (`.vcd`)
- Project folders, each containing code and documentation

## Topics Covered

- Combinational and sequential logic
- Finite state machines
- Simulation and testing with testbenches
- FPGA implementation

## Term Project
-Created an Electronic Battleship Game on FPGA
-Implemented it both digitally on Digital an physically on the FPGA
